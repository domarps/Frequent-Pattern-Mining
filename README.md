README - Machine Problem : Apriori Algorithm for Frequent Pattern Mining


- The submission directory contains three subdirectories, data, psrnvsn2_assign3_codes, psrnvsn2_assign3_results
|-- data
|-- psrnvsn2_assign3_codes
|-- psrnvsn2_assign3_results

```sh
$ python psrnvsn2_apriori_hw3.py <min_support_value>
```

- The data directory is assumed to contain the topic-* files required for the source code.

``` ruby
data/
+-- featureGenerator.py
+-- paper_raw.txt
+-- paper.txt
+-- readme.txt
+-- sample.txt
+-- topic-0.arff
+-- topic-0.txt
+-- topic-1.arff
+-- topic-1.txt
+-- topic-2.arff
+-- topic-2.txt
+-- topic-3.arff
+-- topic-3.txt
+-- topic-4.arff
+-- topic-4.txt
+-- vocab.txt
```
	
- The psrnvsn2_assign3_results contains the following directories(directory and sub-directories automatically created during execution of the script)
``` ruby
 psrnvsn2_assign3_results/
+-- closed
¦   +-- closed-0.txt
¦   +-- closed-1.txt
¦   +-- closed-2.txt
¦   +-- closed-3.txt
+-- max
¦   +-- max-0.txt
¦   +-- max-1.txt
¦   +-- max-2.txt
¦   +-- max-3.txt
+-- patterns
¦   +-- pattern-0.txt
¦   +-- pattern-1.txt
¦   +-- pattern-2.txt
¦   +-- pattern-3.txt
+-- weka
¦   +-- weka-0.txt
¦   +-- weka-1.txt
¦   +-- weka-2.txt
¦   +-- weka-3.txt
```
