README - Machine Problem : Apriori Algorithm for Frequent Pattern Mining


- The submission directory contains three subdirectories, data, psrnvsn2_assign3_codes, psrnvsn2_assign3_results
|-- data
|-- psrnvsn2_assign3_codes
|-- psrnvsn2_assign3_results
    
- The  psrnvsn2_assign3_codes directory contains the source code :  psrnvsn2_apriori_hw3.py

```sh
$ python psrnvsn2_apriori_hw3.py <min_support_value>
```

- The data directory is **assumed** to contain the topic-* files required for the source code.
	|-- data
	|-- featureGenerator.py
	|-- paper_raw.txt
	|-- paper.txt
	|-- readme.txt
	|-- sample.txt
	|-- topic-0.arff
	|-- topic-0.txt
	|-- topic-1.arff
	|-- topic-1.txt
	|-- topic-2.arff
	|-- topic-2.txt
	|-- topic-3.arff
	|-- topic-3.txt
	|-- topic-4.arff
	|-- topic-4.txt
	`-- vocab.txt
- The psrnvsn2_assign3_results contains the following directories(directory and sub-directories automatically created during execution of the script)
	psrnvsn2_assign3_results
    |-- closed  <closed-0.txt,closed-1.txt,closed-2.txt,closed-3.txt,closed-4.txt> created during execution
    |  
    |-- max     <max-0.txt,max-1.txt,max-2.txt,max-3.txt,max-4.txt>		created during execution
    |  
    |-- patterns <pattern-0.txt,pattern-1.txt,pattern-2.txt,pattern-3.txt,pattern-4.txt> created during execution
    |  
    `-- weka   <weka-0.txt,weka-1.txt,weka-2.txt,weka-3.txt,weka-4.txt> created during execution
